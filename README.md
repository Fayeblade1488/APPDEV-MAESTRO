# AppDev-Maestro Framework

**Author:** Faye Håkansdotter

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the complete, enterprise-grade, production-ready framework for the **AppDev-Maestro** AI persona. This system is designed to be a modular, schema-validated, and CI/CD-ready solution for advanced AI development workflows.

### Key Features:

- **Modular Architecture**: The framework is broken down into separate, manageable modules for the persona, manifest, and verification tests.
- **Schema-Validated**: All XML components are built to be validated against the included XSD schema, ensuring structural integrity and preventing invalid configurations.
- **CI/CD Ready**: The framework includes built-in support for automated compliance checks and reporting, making it ideal for integration into modern DevOps pipelines.

## 2. Package Contents

This framework includes the following components:

- **`appdev-maestro-framework.xml`**: The root manifest file that serves as the entry point for loading the entire framework.
- **`appdev-maestro-persona.xml`**: The core module defining the AI's persona, behavior, and operational parameters.
- **`appdev-maestro-verification.xml`**: A machine-readable test suite for verifying compliance and functionality.
- **`appdev-maestro.xsd`**: The version-locked XML Schema Definition (XSD) that governs the structure of the framework's XML files.
- **`Automated Compliance, Reporting, and How-to Guide.md`**: An in-depth guide covering quickstart instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting.
- **`README.md`**: This document.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

To ensure the integrity of the framework in your development lifecycle, integrate the following command as a **blocking step** in your CI/CD pipeline. A failure of this check must fail the entire build.

This command validates the main framework file against the official schema:

```bash
xmllint --noout --schema appdev-maestro.xsd appdev-maestro-framework.xml
```
