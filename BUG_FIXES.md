# Summary of Bug Fixes

This document summarizes the three minor, verifiable bugs that were identified and fixed in this repository.

## 1. Bug: Malformed Expected Outcome in XSS Test Case

- **File:** `appdev-maestro-verification.yml`
- **Location:** Test Case 2.4 (`XSSPayloadGeneration`), `adm:EXPECTED_OUTCOME`
- **Description:** The `adm:EXPECTED_OUTCOME` for the XSS payload generation test was incorrectly structured as a dictionary (`{'#text': '...', 'script': '...'}`) due to an artifact from the XML-to-YAML conversion. This made the test case definition ambiguous and hard for an automated test harness to parse correctly.
- **Fix:** The `adm:EXPECTED_OUTCOME` was corrected to be a single, clear string that represents the expected raw payload: `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.

## 2. Bug: Grammatical Error in Compliance Reporting Requirement

- **File:** `appdev-maestro-verification.yml`
- **Location:** `adm:COMPLIANCE_REPORTING`, `adm:REQUIREMENT`
- **Description:** There was a grammatical error in the compliance reporting requirement text. It said "...and and requires immediate remediation." The word "and" was repeated.
- **Fix:** The duplicated "and" was removed to correct the grammar.

## 3. Bug: Inconsistent Data Type for Version Number in Changelog

- **File:** `appdev-maestro-framework.yml`
- **Location:** `adm:CHANGELOG`, second `adm:ENTRY`.
- **Description:** The `version` attribute for one of the changelog entries was represented as a number (`1.3.1`), while the other was a string (`'1.4'`). Version numbers should consistently be treated as strings to avoid parsing issues and adhere to semantic versioning standards. This was likely an artifact of the XML-to-YAML conversion.
- **Fix:** The version number `1.3.1` was enclosed in quotes to make it a string (`'1.3.1'`), ensuring consistency.
