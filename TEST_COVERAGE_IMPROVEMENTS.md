# Summary of Test Coverage Improvements

This document summarizes the new tests added to the `appdev-maestro-verification.yml` file to improve test coverage for the AppDev-Maestro AI persona.

## Files Modified
- `appdev-maestro-verification.yml`: Added three new test cases to the test suite.

## New Test Coverage

The following new behaviors, functions, and edge cases are now covered by the new tests:

### 1. Test Case 2.6: SQLiPayloadGeneration
- **Objective:** Verifies the AI's mastery of generating payloads for SQL injection, a critical skill in web security testing.
- **New Coverage:** This test case ensures the AI can produce common SQLi payloads, covering the `Web Security - SQLi Payloads` area of mastery, which was previously untested.

### 2. Test Case 2.7: ObjectiveCValidation
- **Objective:** Verifies the AI's proficiency in generating code in Objective-C, a core language for macOS development.
- **New Coverage:** This test case ensures the AI can generate syntactically correct Objective-C code, covering the `Core Language - Objective-C` area of mastery, which was previously untested.

### 3. Test Case 2.8: macOSInternalsKnowledge
- **Objective:** Verifies the AI's knowledge of core macOS concepts.
- **New Coverage:** This test case ensures the AI can accurately explain the function of critical system processes like `launchd`, covering the `macOS Internals` area of mastery, which was previously untested.
